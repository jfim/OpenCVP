Latest Release - Downloadable
I've packaged together the latest stable release:

extension_reflection.tar.gz

It contains the tests, examples, documentation and headers.
It also contains the other Boost libraries that these depend on.
Most of the other libraries are used by the examples,
but not required for using the headers.

To use the library in your project, just add the root of the
extracted directory to your include path
(ie, /home/me/downloads/extension-reflection).

If you want to make sure that the tests pass on your system,
you will need bjam - see
http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_35_0/more/getting_started/index.html,
which includes BJAM setup (you don't need to install the rest of Boost
to use Extension and Reflection - only the subset included here).
Then run the test_redist.sh or test_redist.bat script. If bjam is not
in your path, you'll need to set the variable BOOST_BJAM_PATH. You
can also set BOOST_BJAM_OPTIONS if needed.

I haven't built a Windows .bat file yet, but to replicate the functionality
of the above, set the variables BOOST_ROOT and BOOST_SANDBOX_ROOT to this
directory. Then, run bjam in each of the following directories:

libs/extension/examples
libs/extension/test
libs/reflection/examples
libs/reflection/test

For the documentation, I've only updated the Extension reference
section. The docs are at libs/extension/doc/html/index.html in the
redistributable. I'll post the latest docs up on the site once
I've fixed some of the tutorials.

Feel free to let me know if you have trouble getting the
redistributable to work on a given system - it is a work
in progress.

Also, it can take a little bit of setup to use Extension without
Bjam. If you've worked it out for your compiler/OS, feel free
to send me your instructions and I'll try to post them with
the documentation.
