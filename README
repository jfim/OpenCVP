OpenVP: The Open Vision Platform

Designed to be:
	Fast
		Using C++ and multiple worker threads to distribute the load as equally
		as possible among all cores/processors

	Embeddable
		A simple interface is exposed to allow embedding OpenVP in all kinds of
		applications

	Community-oriented
		The filter library-oriented architecture encourages reuse and sharing
		of filters and components

	An experimentation platform
		A vast library of filters allows rapid prototyping and experimentation
		of new algorithms and approaches to solve a given problem
