OpenCVP: The Open Computer Vision Platform

OpenCVP builds upon OpenCV to make writing computer vision applications easier
than ever!

It features a visual WYSIWYG editor to build computer vision applications and
features an easily embeddable interface to add computer vision to other
applications.

Furthermore, it is licensed under the very permissive BSD license, so that it
can be used in all kinds of applications.

Designed to be:
	Fast
		Using C++ and multiple worker threads to distribute the load as equally
		as possible among all cores/processors

	Embeddable
		A simple interface is exposed to allow embedding OpenCVP in all kinds
		of applications

	Community-oriented
		The filter library-oriented architecture encourages reuse and sharing
		of filters and components with the community

	An experimentation platform
		A vast library of filters allows rapid prototyping and experimentation
		of new algorithms and approaches to solve a given problem
